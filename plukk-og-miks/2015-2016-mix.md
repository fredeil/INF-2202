## Question: Concurrent Linked List

Se under kodesnutter, der ligger en implementasjon i Python av [Joakim SjÃ¸haug](https://github.com/joakimsjo).

### 3a - Coarse-grained synchronisation

> Implement the add and remove function for a singly linked list using coarse-grained synchronisation.
> We are interested in a simple solution that is thread safe.

### 3b - Starvation

> What is starvation? Can starvation be a problem for your coarse-grained synchronisation implementation in a)?

### 3c - Contention

> An issue with coarse-grained synchronization is contention.
> What is contention? Why can we experience contention in systems?

### 3d - Fine grained synchronisation

> Re-implement the add and remove functions using fine-grained synchronization.
> We are interested in a solution where individual nodes in the list can be locked.
